# Background

This is aims to be an idiomatic, up-to-date example of a Kotlin Multi-Platform Client/Server Application.

It is intended both as a learning resource, and as a basis for forking new real-world Application repositories.

The Server portion is written using JetBrain's [Ktor framework](https://ktor.io/) and builds as a [WAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAR_(file_format)), suitable for hosting by [Jetty](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/), [TomCat](https://tomcat.apache.org/) or other Java Web-Application container.

Clients are built for:
* Android
  * Mobile / Tablet
  * TV
* JavaFX Desktop
