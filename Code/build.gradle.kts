/**
 * The approach taken in this file is an attempt to maximise the efficiency of
 * building by a GradleBuild task-per-platform.
 *
 * That approach itself is known not to be the most efficient way of building
 * the entire project; since Gradle cannot consider the whole task-graph across
 * each GradleBuild invocation, leading to repeat builds of shared libraries.
 * The most efficient outcome would be to write an overarching Gradle project
 * which treats each Platform as a sub-project.
 * I experimented with this in a previous commit but it has complications and I
 * want to move ahead with other aspects of the Template development.
 * The best-compromise approach here collects all the tasks demanded of the
 * current whole-App build to at least ensure only one GradleBuild invocation per
 * Platform with, say, the tasks for testing and deploying a given platform
 * unified into it's own task graph.
 * This is particularly useful when on a Development machine I may wish to
 * invoke just the Unit Tests for a whole platform, while on a CI box (where
 * repeated overall Gradle invocations are costly due to Daemon startup and
 * Cache Storage/Retrieval) it is preferable to have build, test and deploy
 * all handled in a single Gradle invocation (albeit multi-GradleBuild).
